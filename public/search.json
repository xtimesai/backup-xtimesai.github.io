However, the accuracy and usefulness of the AI answers have proven to be mixed.\nAs of Oct. 28, users in more than 100 countries and territories can access AI Overviews, Google’s explanatory, generative widget that appears above some Search engine results.\nThe tech giant first launched the feature in the U.S. before gradually expanding to additional regions. With its latest expansion, AI Overviews can now be accessed in Canada, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East, Colombia, Chile, and many more locations.\n“With AI Overviews in Search, it’s easier than ever for people to find the information they need and discover relevant sites across the web, which opens up more opportunities to connect with publishers, businesses and creators,” wrote Google VP of Search Quality Srinivasan (Cheenu) Venkatachary in a press release.\nAI Overviews in Search Continues Worldwide Expansion When AI Overviews launched in May, it was initially available only to users in the U.S. By August, access had been expanded to include the United Kingdom, India, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil.\nThen, in October, Google added to AI Overviews’ language offerings: It can now parse and answer questions in:\nEnglish Hindi Indonesian Japanese Portuguese Spanish As Google noted, language is not tied to a geographical location. Google will now be able to accurately claim 1 billion global users use its AI products, since AI Overviews appears in Search by default.\nSEE: Google Chrome: Security and UI tips you need to know (TechRepublic Premium)\nMore Google news \u0026 tips Google Gemini Cheat Sheet (Formerly Google Bard): What Is Google Gemini, and How Does It Work?

Top 6 Jamboard Alternatives \u0026 Competitors for 2024 (Free \u0026 Paid) Power Checklist: Managing and Troubleshooting Android Devices Competitors and risks to AI in Search AI-generated answers to Search Engine queries have been a hot topic since generative AI went mainstream. Microsoft incorporated its Copilot chatbot into Bing Search. Perplexity AI built a conversational, AI-first search bot that draws information from Google and Bing. The Arc browser provides AI-generated blurbs to answer questions in Arc Search.\nHowever, AI-powered search engines display the weaknesses of generative AI in an environment where accurate information is paramount. Google AI Overviews infamously made up nonsensical or dangerous answers when it first launched. Generative AI search functions sometimes struggle to accurately distinguish between current events and past occurrences, or to answer relatively uncommon questions.\nI’ve found Google AI Overviews tends to answer “how” or “what” questions even if I type in a “why” question. It can sometimes feel like a buffer between my initial question and an answer Google would once have provided at a glance. AI Overviews may sacrifice context and authority, leading users to alternate search engines or forums like Reddit.\n“[T]he feedback we’ve received for AI Overviews has been highly positive,” according to Venkatachary. “People prefer using Search with AI Overviews, and they find their search results more helpful.”\nAI Overviews has been controversial with media publishers, who worry that it will take views away from websites. In response, Google has added source links on the right-hand side of the panel, making it easier for users to click through to the original sources of information. In October, Google added in-line links for similar reasons.\n“In our testing, these updates drove an increase in traffic to supporting websites compared to the previous designs,” Venkatachary wrote.\nWhile it’s uncertain if AI Overviews will stick around for the long haul, Google’s expanded rollout suggests a strong current commitment to the feature.\nSubscribe to the Google Weekly Newsletter Learn how to get the most out of Google Docs, Google Cloud Platform, Google Apps, Chrome OS, and all the other Google products used in business environments.

The pace of change, coupled with global challenges, can shake the most steadfast hearts. Yet, amidst this chaos, a simple yet profound truth remains: everything is coming together for you. This belief isn’t just optimism; it’s a mindset shift that can transform how you navigate life’s trials.\nHere’s how you can cultivate this resilient mindset and align with the deeper flow of life, even when circumstances seem bleak.\nAnchor Yourself in Faith Faith is the compass that guides you through uncharted waters. It isn’t limited to religion or spirituality—it’s the unwavering belief that life, with all its twists and turns, ultimately works in your favor. Embrace Uncertainty: Accept that you won’t always have all the answers, and that’s okay. Faith thrives in the unknown. Focus on Growth: Each challenge is a stepping stone. What lesson can you draw from today’s struggle? How is it shaping you into a stronger version of yourself? Practice Gratitude: Gratitude is the foundation of faith. By appreciating what you already have, you cultivate trust in life’s abundance.\nPatience: The Quiet Power Patience isn’t passive; it’s an active, conscious choice to trust the process. When things don’t move as quickly as you’d like, patience becomes your ally, helping you stay grounded and hopeful. Resist Comparison: It’s easy to feel left behind when you measure your progress against others. Remember, your path is unique. Break Down Goals: If the big picture feels too overwhelming, focus on small, manageable steps. Celebrate each one. Shift Perspective: Sometimes, delays or setbacks are life’s way of redirecting you to something better.\nTrust That Everything is Coming Together This isn’t just wishful thinking—it’s a practical mindset that trains your brain to see opportunities where others see obstacles. Adopt a Positive Narrative: How you interpret your life’s events matters. Instead of “Why is this happening to me?” ask, “How is this working for me?” Look for Signs of Alignment: Pay attention to serendipities—those “coincidences” that hint at a bigger plan unfolding. Visualize Your Future Self: Imagine the person you’re becoming. Let that vision guide your actions today.\nDraw Strength from Past Victories Think back to moments when you faced difficulties and overcame them. You’ve survived 100% of your hardest days. Let this be a reminder of your resilience and capability.\nSurround Yourself with Positivity Your environment shapes your mindset. Choose people, content, and activities that uplift and inspire you.\nNurture Supportive Relationships: Lean on friends, family, or mentors who encourage your faith and patience. Feed Your Mind: Read books, listen to podcasts, or watch videos that reinforce your belief in better days ahead.\nEmbrace the Journey, Not Just the Destination Life isn’t a race to the finish line; it’s a tapestry woven with moments of joy, struggle, and everything in between. By embracing the journey, you free yourself from the pressure of perfection and allow life to unfold naturally. A Mantra to Hold On To Whenever doubt creeps in, remind yourself: “I trust the timing of my life. I am exactly where I need to be. Everything is working out for my highest good.”\nIn this ever-changing world, keeping your faith strong and your patience steady isn’t just about enduring—it’s about thriving. Trust that life is not happening to you but for you. Hold on, stay the course, and watch as everything comes together, just as it was meant to.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

While the path forward may sometimes seem unclear, understanding the power of patience can transform our perspective and help us navigate difficult times with grace and resilience.\nThe Nature of Change Change, like a river carving its path through stone, often works slowly but inexorably. Nature itself teaches us this lesson - mighty oaks grow from tiny acorns, not overnight, but through seasons of patient development. Similarly, meaningful personal growth and life changes rarely happen in sudden bursts, but rather through consistent, gradual progress.\nWhy Patience Matters Inner Peace When we embrace patience, we release the burden of constant urgency. This mental shift allows us to find tranquility even amid uncertainty, creating space for clarity and wisdom to emerge. Rather than exhausting ourselves fighting against time, we learn to flow with it.\nBetter Decisions Patience enables thoughtful decision-making. When we resist the urge to force immediate solutions, we give ourselves the gift of perspective. This measured approach often leads to choices that better serve our long-term wellbeing.\nEmotional Resilience Patient people tend to experience less stress and anxiety. By accepting that some outcomes require time to unfold, we build emotional resilience and maintain hope even when faced with setbacks.\nCultivating Patience Practice Mindfulness Stay present in the moment rather than constantly reaching for the future. Simple practices like deep breathing or meditation can strengthen your capacity for patience.\nCelebrate Small Wins Acknowledge and appreciate incremental progress. Every step forward, no matter how small, brings you closer to your goals.\nMaintain Perspective Remember that difficult periods are temporary. Just as seasons change, life’s circumstances will evolve. Trust in the natural ebb and flow of experience.\nLooking Forward While waiting for positive change, use this time to prepare yourself for better days ahead. Develop new skills, nurture relationships, or work on personal growth. Let patience be not just a passive waiting, but an active preparation for future opportunities.\nFinal Thoughts In a world that often demands instant gratification, choosing patience is a radical act of self-compassion. Trust that things will change for the better, and let this knowledge give you strength. Your patience today is planting seeds for tomorrow’s garden of possibilities.\nRemember: The darkest hour is just before dawn. Keep faith, stay patient, and watch as new opportunities and positive changes unfold in their own perfect time.\n","description":"10 Essential Steps to Enjoying a Life You Love","tags":["life coaching","self-improvement","personal development"],"title":"Be Patient: Things Will Change for the Better","uri":"/post/be-patient/"},{"content":"Life coaching doesn’t always require hiring a professional.

The secret isn’t in creating complex custom websites from scratch - it’s in working smarter with templates and providing real value to local businesses. This guide breaks down a proven process that has helped people transition from struggling freelancers to successful digital entrepreneurs.\nThe Core Problem with Traditional Freelancing Many freelance web developers face a common challenge: income inconsistency. One month they might make $5,000-$6,000, but the next month could bring zero income. This feast-or-famine cycle makes it difficult to build a sustainable business. The solution? A systematic approach to finding clients and creating recurring revenue.\nThe Four-Step Process 1. Finding the Right Clients Start by choosing a specific niche. Here’s how:\nUse industry spending data to identify profitable niches Look for businesses that have high customer lifetime value Focus on industries where one customer/lead is worth $100+ Target businesses without existing websites Pro Tip: Use Google Maps or tools like Outscraper to find potential clients systematically.\n2. Reaching Out to Potential Customers The proven outreach strategy involves:\nTemplate Message: \"Hey, are you still open? I tried to look up your website and see reviews when searching for a [business type] in [location] but couldn't find one. This is a bit random, but I decided to build you one - would it be cool if I send you a link to the new website on this email? Let me know if you like it.\" Contact methods include:\nCold calling SMS messages Voicemail drops Emails Direct messages 3. Making Sales Easy The key to successful sales is showing value upfront:\nCreate a template website for their industry Use their logo and basic business information Present the website on a Zoom call (don’t just send a link) Use the presentation to diagnose their business needs Look for upsell opportunities during the conversation 4. Creating Multiple Revenue Streams Structure your services in tiers:\nBasic Services ($150-200/month) Website hosting and maintenance Basic updates Domain management Intermediate Services ($300/month) Lead follow-up systems Chatbots Google review management Database reactivation Missed call text-back Advanced Services ($1,500-4,000/month) SEO Google Business Profile optimization Google Ads management Facebook Ads Comprehensive marketing services Custom website development Best Practices for Success Start Simple: Begin with basic website services and expand as you gain confidence Focus on Volume: Don’t spend too much time perfecting each site - use templates effectively Leverage Tools: Use GoHighLevel or similar platforms for templates Utilize ChatGPT for content creation Implement automation tools for outreach Offer Free Trials: Consider a 30-day free trial to reduce friction in the sales process Customize Your Pitch: Focus on services that solve your client’s specific problems The Power of Recurring Revenue The real magic of this business model isn’t in one-time website sales - it’s in building a base of monthly recurring revenue. By offering ongoing services and maintenance, you create:\nPredictable monthly income Stronger client relationships Opportunities for upselling A more valuable business Conclusion Building a successful website business isn’t about being the best developer or designer - it’s about providing valuable solutions to local businesses. By following this systematic approach and focusing on recurring revenue, you can build a sustainable business that generates significant monthly income.\nRemember: Start with one niche, perfect your process, and gradually expand your services as you gain experience and confidence.\nDisclaimer: Income figures mentioned are examples and not guaranteed. Success requires dedication, consistent effort, and effective implementation of these strategies.\n","description":"Learn how to build a profitable website business by offering services to local businesses, from finding clients to scaling your income with recurring revenue.","tags":["websites","digital nomad","freelancing","local business","passive income"],"title":"How to Build a $20k/Month Website Business: A Complete Guide","uri":"/post/how-to-build-a-20k-per-month-website-business/"},{"content":"how to ensure the archetypes/bundle-post/index.md file exists.?

Netlify is like a free hosting service for your website - think of it as a place that makes your website available to everyone on the internet. It’s especially good for static websites (like those built with Hugo) because:\nIt’s completely free for basic use It’s very fast It’s easy to set up It automatically updates your site when you make changes Setting Up Your Site on Netlify Step 1: Prepare Your Configuration Create a file called netlify.toml in your main project folder. This file tells Netlify how to handle your website:\n[build] publish = \"public\" # This tells Netlify where your finished website files are command = \"hugo --gc --minify\" # This tells Netlify to use Hugo to build your site # Settings for your main website [context.production.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.82.0\" # Specifies which version of Hugo to use HUGO_ENV = \"production\" # Tells Hugo this is for your live website HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = \"true\" # Allows Hugo to use Git information # Settings for different deployment scenarios [context.split1] command = \"hugo --gc --minify --enableGitInfo\" [context.split1.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.82.0\" HUGO_ENV = \"production\" # Settings for preview deployments (when you want to test changes) [context.deploy-preview] command = \"hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\" [context.deploy-preview.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.82.0\" # Settings for branch deployments [context.branch-deploy] command = \"hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\" [context.branch-deploy.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.82.0\" [context.next.environment] HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = \"true\" Step 2: Choose Your Deployment Method You have two ways to get your website onto Netlify:\nOption 1: Direct Upload Build your Hugo site locally (run hugo command) Go to Netlify’s website Sign up or log in Drag and drop your public folder onto Netlify’s dashboard Your site is live! Option 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended) Put your Hugo site on GitHub Log in to Netlify Click “New site from Git” Choose GitHub and select your repository Netlify will automatically: Build your site whenever you update GitHub Deploy your changes Handle all the technical details Step 3: Custom Domain (Optional) Netlify gives you a free domain like your-site-name.netlify.app You can add your own custom domain through Netlify’s settings Netlify even provides free HTTPS certificates Tips for Success Always test your site locally before pushing to GitHub Make sure your Hugo version in netlify.toml matches the version you use locally Keep your public folder in your .gitignore file if using GitHub Use Netlify’s deploy previews to check changes before they go live Common Issues and Solutions Build Fails\nCheck your Hugo version matches netlify.toml Make sure all your theme files are included Images Not Showing\nCheck your image paths are correct Make sure images are in the static folder Deployment Stuck\nCheck your repository permissions Verify your build settings in netlify.toml Need help?

They enable enhanced flexibility and are a core part of Hugo’s functionality, offering reusable snippets for embedding media, custom components, or dynamic content. Below, we’ll explore what shortcodes are and highlight some popular examples.\nWhat are Hugo Shortcodes? Shortcodes in Hugo are like mini-templates that simplify embedding specialized content into a page. Hugo has built-in shortcodes, and users can create custom ones. For instance, to embed a YouTube video, instead of writing the full HTML, you can use a shortcode like {{/*\u003c youtube \"video-id\" \u003e */}}.\nCommon Built-in Shortcodes Here are a few popular Hugo shortcodes and how to use them:\nYouTube Embed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44 Shortcode:\n{{\u003c youtube 3qHkcs3kG44 \u003e}} Rendered output: This shortcode takes a YouTube video ID, simplifying the process of embedding videos on your page.\nFigure: Shortcode:\n{{/*\u003c figure src=\"/img/posts/img-0.jpg\" title=\"Sample Image\" \u003e*/}} Rendered output: Sample Image This allows you to easily add images with captions and titles, handling image display responsively.\nGist (GitHub Snippets):\nShortcode:\n{{/*\u003c gist spf13 7896402 \u003e */}} Rendered: This integrates GitHub Gists by taking the username and gist ID, perfect for adding code snippets from GitHub.\nTwitter url:\nhttps://twitter.com/binovarghese_/status/1758148486510317907 Shortcode:\n{{\u003c twitter user=\"binovarghese_\" id=\"1758148486510317907\" \u003e}} Rendered: {{\u003c twitter user=“binovarghese_” id=“1758148486510317907” \u003e}}\nBenefits of Shortcodes Using shortcodes in Hugo streamlines content creation and ensures consistency across pages, saving time on repeated elements and complex HTML structures. With custom shortcodes, you can build rich, interactive content while keeping Markdown files clean and easy to manage.\nFor more details, check out Hugo’s official shortcode documentation.\n","description":"Hugo shortcodes are powerful tools for adding custom HTML or other special content within Markdown files without complex code...","tags":["shortcodes"],"title":"Understanding Hugo Shortcodes","uri":"/post/understanding-hugo-shortcodes/"},{"content":"To create your own shortcodes in Hugo, add an HTML file in layouts/shortcodes/.

Netlify is popular for its ease of use, free hosting tier, and powerful features like automated builds, custom domain support, and built-in SSL. With Hugo’s efficient static site generation, deploying on Netlify enables fast, seamless updates and management.\nStep 1: Set Up netlify.toml Configuration The netlify.toml file is essential for configuring build settings in Netlify. Here’s a setup tailored for various deployment environments, including production, deploy previews, and branch deploys.\nAdd the following netlify.toml file to your Hugo project’s root directory:\n[build] publish = \"public\" command = \"hugo --gc --minify\" [context.production.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" HUGO_ENV = \"production\" HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = \"false\" [context.split1] command = \"hugo --gc --minify --enableGitInfo\" [context.split1.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" HUGO_ENV = \"production\" [context.deploy-preview] command = \"hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\" [context.deploy-preview.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" [context.branch-deploy] command = \"hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\" [context.branch-deploy.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" [context.next.environment] HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = \"false\" Explanation of Key Parameters Build Command: hugo --gc --minify triggers garbage collection (--gc) and minifies output. HUGO_VERSION: Specifies the Hugo version to avoid compatibility issues. HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO: Used for tracking commit metadata in production. Deployment Contexts: Production: Builds optimized, production-ready files. Deploy Preview: Builds the site using the pull request URL, helpful for staging. Branch Deploy: Enables previews for branches other than the main one. Step 2: Connect Your Repository to Netlify Log In to Netlify: Go to Netlify.\nCreate a New Site: Choose “New site from Git” from the dashboard.\nSelect Your Repository: Choose GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, authenticate, and select your Hugo site repository.\nConfigure Build Settings:\nBuild Command: Leave as hugo. Publish Directory: Set as public (Netlify automatically reads from netlify.toml if it’s present). Deploy Your Site: Click “Deploy site” to initiate the first build. Netlify will pull from your repository, build, and deploy the site, which you can access via the provided default Netlify URL (e.g., https://example-site.netlify.app).\nStep 3: Preview and Customize Your Site Once the build completes, visit the live preview URL to verify that your site is working correctly.\nStep 4: Set Up a Custom Domain (Optional) To configure a custom domain:\nGo to the Netlify dashboard, select “Domain settings,” and add your domain. Follow the provided DNS setup instructions. If you want Netlify to manage DNS, you can transfer the domain or add a Netlify DNS record. Netlify automatically provisions an SSL certificate through Let’s Encrypt, adding secure HTTPS to your site. Step 5: Enable Continuous Deployment Netlify supports continuous deployment by default. Each push to your repository triggers a new build and redeploys the latest changes. This makes it easy to manage updates or collaborate with others on site changes.\nConclusion Deploying a Hugo site on Netlify offers a streamlined experience, leveraging Hugo’s fast builds with Netlify’s advanced hosting features. With a few simple steps, your site is live, secure, and ready for easy content updates directly from Git.\nThis setup is ideal for efficient deployment with customized environments, making it easy to manage development and production versions and maintain a polished, dynamic website.\n","description":"Hosting a Hugo site on Netlify is an effective solution for deploying static websites, combining Hugo’s speed with Netlify’s robust features..","tags":["hugo","Netlify"],"title":"Hosting Your Hugo Site on Netlify","uri":"/post/netlify-configuration/"},{"content":"Below is a list of configurable parameters in the Lightbi theme, along with descriptions to help you customize your site effectively.

Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text formatting language used for creating styled text through simple, readable syntax. Developed by John Gruber in 2004, its goal is to allow writers to format documents without complex code, making it easy to read and edit. The beauty of Markdown lies in its simplicity, allowing creators to add headings, lists, images, links, and more by typing a few symbols around their text.\nFor instance:\nTyping **bold text** makes text bold. Writing # at the beginning of a line turns it into a heading, and more # symbols make it a smaller subheading. Lists can be created using - or * for bullets or numbers for ordered lists. Because Markdown converts text to HTML, it’s perfect for web content creation, blog posts, documentation, and technical writing, all while remaining easy to format in a non-HTML context. Markdown files, saved as .md or .markdown files, are compatible with many popular platforms like GitHub, Reddit, and Hugo, making it a preferred choice for developers, writers, and content creators.\nUsing Markdown allows for better productivity and collaboration because anyone can edit or view Markdown text without needing HTML or specialized knowledge. Its clean, minimalistic approach makes it accessible and effective for writing that needs to balance readability and formatting.\n","description":"Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text formatting language used for creating styled text through simple, readable syntax....","tags":["markdown"],"title":"What is Markdown ?","uri":"/post/markdown/"},{"content":"Headings To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (h3), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header). Heading level 1 Heading level 2 Heading level 3 Heading level 4 Heading level 5 Heading level 6 Paragraphs To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.\nMarkdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.\nMarkdown was developed in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz. Gruber wrote the first markdown-to-html converter in Perl, and it soon became widely used in websites. By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many languages.\nBold To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.\n**bold text**\nItalic To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

Couldn’t figure it out from there. No suitable gurus could be found to answer this question.\nThe search continued, and the only sound in my heart was to go ahead. The answer is nowhere to be found. So I’m still looking around, and the answer to my question is hidden somewhere.\nI do not know, some questions take time to answer. The meaning of a single word question is getting bigger and bigger.
