  <p>Who am I ?! This is the most asked question in my life. Yet no clear answer has yet been found.</p>
<p>As a child, the answer to this question was simple. Say my name to the question of who. Aha ..! Simple and beautiful. In that answer, parents and siblings in adolescence. I thought to myself that the answer was too clear.</p>
<p>When I started asking myself this question at a young age when I was beginning to recognize many things, I began to feel that the answer was becoming less clear. Who am I ?! If you ask me who I am. Anyone else. Still no answer to the question. Who am I?</p>
<p>Seek, that is the way to find the answer. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you !! The investigation has begun.</p>
<p>There is no doubt where to start. From me. I began to search the bottom of my heart in the silence. From there the search went on to the printed books. Couldn&rsquo;t figure it out from there. No suitable gurus could be found to answer this question.</p>
<p>The search continued, and the only sound in my heart was to go ahead. The answer is nowhere to be found. So I&rsquo;m still looking around, and the answer to my question is hidden somewhere.</p>
<p>I do not know, some questions take time to answer. The meaning of a single word question is getting bigger and bigger. Who am I ?! What is my identity ?! What are my missions ?! Can I know the light of the answers ?!</p>
<p>Those who ask the same questions go up the steps of consciousness and seem to be enlightened and insane. What will I become at the end of this question? !! Buddha or mad !! Anyone should have a small smile left at the end. The smile of recognition.</p>
<p>Who am I, let the question continue.</p>
